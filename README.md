# Python Proxy

This is the final project made for my networking class at Washington State University

# Steps to configure Proxy:

First In your browser set up a proxy for localhost and port 4550
I used iceweasel/mozilla firefox, to do this- 

1. open your browser then click the three bar icon upper right (open menu)

2. click the wrench icon that says developer, on the left pane go to Advanced

3. in that window click settings change the radio button "no proxy" to "Manual proxy configuration" and set HTTP Proxy to localhost and
port to 4550 and set HTTP Proxy to localhost. 

4. Then in the textbox
for "No Proxy For" add localhost, 127.0.0.1

# Step to run Proxy:

1. in your terminal run: proxyproject

2. Navigate to any website and watch the terminal logging output
